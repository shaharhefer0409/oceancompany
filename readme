# Ocean Watchers - Website Project Requirements

## 🌊 Project Overview

**Ocean Watchers** is a non-profit organization dedicated to marine life conservation and achieving plastic-free oceans. We need a front-end developer to build a responsive, immersive, and visually striking website that reflects the depth and fluidity of the ocean.

**Goal:** Create a static website using only HTML5 and CSS3 that informs visitors about our mission, showcases marine life, and encourages community involvement.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** (Semantic structure)
- **CSS3** (Styling, Flexbox, Grid, Animations)
- **No JavaScript** required for this phase (CSS-only interactivity preferred).

---

## 🎨 Design & Aesthetics

The site must feel "deep," fluid, and modern. Avoid static, blocky designs.

### Color Palette

- **Primary (Backgrounds):** Deep Ocean Blue `#001f3f`
- **Secondary (Buttons/Highlights):** Teal/Cyan `#39CCCC`
- **Accent (Urgent CTAs):** Coral `#FF7F50`
- **Text Color:** Off-white/Light Gray `#F0F8FF` (High contrast against dark backgrounds)

### Typography

- **Headings:** Bold and modern (e.g., _Montserrat_ or _Oswald_).
- **Body Text:** Clean and rounded (e.g., _Quicksand_ or _Nunito_).

### Visual Style

- **Gradients:** Use `linear-gradient` for buttons and footers to simulate water depth.
- **Transparency:** Use `rgba` colors for content containers so the background is faintly visible behind the text.
- **Transitions:** All interactive elements (links, buttons) must have smooth states (`transition: all 0.3s ease`).

---

## 📄 Core Pages & Content Structure

### 1. Home Page (`index.html`)

- **Hero Section:** Full-width background (video or high-res image) with the headline **"Turn the Tide"** and a CTA button.
- **Problem Section:** A **split-screen layout** (50% text / 50% image) explaining the crisis of plastic pollution.
- **Newsletter:** A wide horizontal banner at the bottom for email signup.

### 2. Marine Life Gallery (`gallery.html`)

- **Layout:** A **CSS Grid** layout displaying endangered animals (Turtles, Whales, Reefs).
- **Interactivity:**
  - **Hover Effect:** Cards must scale up slightly (`transform: scale(1.05)`) on hover.
  - **Reveal:** A caption or name should appear or highlight upon hovering.

### 3. Campaigns (`campaigns.html`)

- **Content:** Active projects (e.g., "Beach Cleanup 2026", "Ban the Straw").
- **Layout:** Use **Flexbox** to align campaign cards in rows that wrap automatically.

### 4. Get Involved (`volunteer.html`)

- **Schedule Table:** An HTML `<table>` styled with CSS showing cleanup dates, locations, and open slots.
- **Volunteer Form:**
  - Fields: Name, Email, Diving Certification Level (Select Dropdown), Message.
  - Style: Clean input borders with focus states.

### 5. Contact (`contact.html`)

- Standard contact details and a row of Social Media icons.

---

## 📱 Responsiveness (Mobile-First)

The website must be fully responsive for all device sizes.

1.  **Navigation:**
    - Sticky header (stays at the top while scrolling).
    - Must feature a semi-transparent background (`backdrop-filter: blur` or opacity).
2.  **Grid Behavior:**
    - The "Marine Life" grid must collapse to a **single-column layout** on screens smaller than 768px.
3.  **Touch Targets:**
    - Buttons must be large enough for easy tapping on mobile devices.

---

## 📦 Deliverables

1.  **Source Code:** All `.html` files and the external `style.css` file.
2.  **Assets:** An `images/` folder containing optimized assets (or placeholders).
3.  **Documentation:** This `README.md` file included in the root directory.
4.  **Code Quality:**
    - Semantic HTML tags (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`).
    - Well-commented CSS (e.g., `/* --- Hero Section --- */`).
